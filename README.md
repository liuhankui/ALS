# ALS workflow
#### 1 script.r is the main workflow that analysis the association between scRNA data and diseases-related genes and then generate fig1-3 and supplement table 6-7.


#### 2 notice that figures generated by script.r maybe little different to the figures in manuscript.


#### 3 files with .txt and .rda suffix in data/ are employed in script.r


# Usage:

git clone --recursive https://github.com/liuhankui/ALS.git

cd ALS/

Rscript script.r
