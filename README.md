# ALS workflow
1. script.r is the main workflow that analysis the association between scRNA data and diseases-related genes and then generate fig1-4 and supplement table 6.


2. notice that figures generated by script.r maybe little different to the figures in manuscript.


3. filr with .txt and .rda suffix in data/ are employed in script.r


4. scripts in EWCE/ are the core function that used for enrichment analysis once you can not install EWCE R-package.
